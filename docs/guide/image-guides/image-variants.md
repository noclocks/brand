# Image Variants

Image variants are different versions of an image that are optimized for specific use cases, devices, or platforms. By creating multiple variants of an image, you can ensure that the image displays correctly and loads quickly across various contexts, such as websites, mobile apps, social media, and email campaigns.

Optimizing image variants involves adjusting the image dimensions, resolution, file format, compression, and quality to meet the requirements of different devices and platforms. By tailoring the image variants to specific use cases, you can enhance the user experience, improve performance, and create visually appealing content that resonates with your audience.
