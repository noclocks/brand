# Digital Asset Management Taxonomy

> Digital asset management taxonomy is the structure in which you organize, categorize, and classify brand assets for end-users. It includes metadata and a controlled vocabulary of descriptive terms to define, tag, and search digital content.

## Overview

We're all familiar with the age-old folder/subfolder (“parent/child”) hierarchical structure — in [file storage solutions](https://brandfolder.com/resources/file-storage-for-business/index.html) like Google Drive, OneDrive, or SharePoint, or when saving files on your computer. It's simple and straightforward, in theory… but anyone who's tried managing content in this format knows how limiting it can be.

That's why DAMs change things up: allowing users the flexibility to **create a flat file taxonomy.** This offers several benefits for admins managing assets and end-users who need to find and use content:

-   **You have more control over the layout of your file library.** Design your digital asset management taxonomy around unique user needs, content types, asset use cases, and more to improve browsability, findability, and discoverability. *Users can browse your media library and see what's available to them, find specific files, and discover new content that's been added to the DAM.*
-   **Users don't have to know the exact file location, name, or pathway to find content** because the search functionality is powered by metadata, tags, categories, and filters (in the structure of your taxonomy). Users can search descriptive terms about assets, or phrases related to their projects, to locate exact files or see new content available to use in brand collateral.
-   **Asset placement is also based on metadata rules;** this allows you to store files in multiple locations without having to make (or hassle with) duplicate files. As a result, this improves file version control, collaboration, and brand consistency.
-   **A strong file taxonomy also improves visibility in your asset library:** admins can see what content is available to users and search through expired assets to keep a record of past content creation or repurpose existing collateral.
-   **It improves the DAM platform's overall usability and effectiveness** and allows you to optimize asset usage — users can interact with your content library without confusion, make the best use of (all) your brand's available content, and work with [brand assets](https://brandfolder.com/resources/what-is-a-brand-asset/index.html) more productively. *No more buried content, messy folders, or duplicate files.*

But creating a solid and logical DAM taxonomy is crucial to reaping those benefits. And although most brands with large content libraries already have *some* structure to organize files, weeding through existing files, cleaning up your storage drive, and re-mapping content (in the most strategic way) requires careful execution and knowledge of [DAM best practices](https://brandfolder.com/resources/DAM-best-practices/).

We also put together this guide with our recommendations to build a strong digital asset management taxonomy and successfully switch to DAM software.

**Let's run through the five steps to structure and maintain your brand's digital asset management taxonomy:**

1.  Audit your existing assets
2.  Organize assets for your DAM system
3.  Map asset metadata and tags
4.  Review and finalize your asset taxonomy
5.  Make updates as your asset library grows

## 1. Audit Existing Assets and Consider Current Organizational Structure

*What’s the state of your storage drive?*

The first step to creating a digital asset management taxonomy is to look at your existing assets. Is your current storage solution neatly organized? Are folders mapped logically? Can you easily find assets when searching?

*In most cases, these answers are “No.”* Many teams come to us with a disorganized storage drive: assets living in multiple places, outdated and duplicate assets, and an unclear folder structure.

However, these file storage drives didn’t *start* messy, so we advise teams to think back to the folder structure they had initially envisioned. How were assets originally organized? Do you need to clean up your drive with the folder structure you mapped out in the past (and optimize the old structure to accommodate new assets)? Or are you looking at a complete overhaul?

Once you decide where to begin, audit your brand’s asset library to perform a clean-up and start thinking of ways to reorganize:

-   Take note of duplicate assets, where they live, and if they need to be deleted or merged with an updated file.
-   Update file names and determine whether your assets follow strict file naming conventions.
-   Delete or archive old content you no longer want or need.

After you wrap up your review, you can start mapping out your asset library.

## 2. Organize Asset Library Around End-User Needs

*What makes sense to your teams & stakeholders?*

When mapping your taxonomy design, don’t just aim for a “clean-looking DAM” — consider both the type of content you have to organize *and* the user experience (i.e., how end-users will navigate your DAM solution and find the assets they need).

Ask yourself: How do your teams search for content in your existing drive? What type of content do they need? If you were the one searching for this collateral, how would you prefer to browse?

It’s also a good idea to interview teammates or partners who use your existing storage drive to learn more about how they search for files. You can ask how they would search for specific types of content, dig into the pains they experience, learn about commonly-used search terms, and more. These insights can help you develop metadata, tags, and filters around user preferences.

If assets are too hard to find or your DAM is a headache to navigate (even if it looks “clean”), team members will be less inclined to use brand collateral.

On the other hand, mapping an intuitive asset library enables self-service. All users can come into your Brandfolder and pull content for their unique projects *without asking anyone for help.* This eases the burden on your creative team to respond to asset requests and review digital projects, letting everyone work more efficiently.

Now, because the way you organize assets depends highly on your industry, the type of content that you have, and your teams’ use cases, we can’t spell out one specific way to map your asset library. However, we often see teams organize assets by:

-   **Brand** — in top-level Brandfolders
-   **Collections** (within Brandfolders) — Product line, service, content type, sales or marketing campaign, season, or use case
-   **Brand Portals** — End-user groups (i.e., specific teams or departments, agency partners, retailers, manufacturers, etc.)

## 3. Map Asset Metadata and Tags to Improve Search and Discovery
