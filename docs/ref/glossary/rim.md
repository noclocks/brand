# Remote Infrastructure Management (RIM)

> Remote infrastructure management is the process of moving the management of IT hardware, software, services, and functionality to the cloud. RIM may be carried out by your internal IT team, a remote infrastructure management service, or even specialized software.

## Workflow

### Map Out Existing Components and Vendors

Before you can implement RIM, you’ll want to have a good handle on all of your current systems and processes.

Start by making a list of all the organization-wide hardware and software components you currently use. Then, list the service contracts and vendors your teams rely on. Your lists may include network applications, hardware vendors, servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), identity management solutions, and more.

### Identify What Can be Virtualized or Managed Remotely

Look at the lists you made in step one. Ask yourself the following about each item:

-   Is this a mission-critical component for core business operations?
-   Is this component compatible with our other systems?
-   Can this component be installed, upgraded, and managed remotely? If not, is there a comparable remote management-friendly option we can migrate to?
-   Is this process or system one that can be fully or partially automated?
-   Can this system or component be accessed by its end users remotely?

From here, you can begin to explore possible new solutions such as:

-   Replacing non-remote-compatible services and components with flexible alternatives
-   Opting for one comprehensive enterprise software solution to replace multiple similar products licensed by different departments in your company
-   Moving from on-site servers to a remote or virtual server option
-   Improving virtual private network (VPN) systems for better remote access
-   Identifying and integrating AI and automation services to streamline recurring tasks

This step may involve multiple revisions as you continue to evaluate and refine your RIM options.

### Determine How You Will Provide Hardware to Remote Team Members

Your team will need to have the right hardware at their disposal in order to work remotely. Even if the entire company works in-office right now, you’ll want to have a hardware distribution plan in place. If your team needs to suddenly go remote due to an impactful event, do you know how you will get essential workstation equipment to them?

Think about the following:

-   Can you increase the likelihood of successful remote work by moving from desktop computers to laptops?
-   Who should be assigned a company laptop?
-   How will you distribute company hardware?
-   What level of support will your IT team be able to offer for bring-your-own-device (BYOD)?
-   How will you manage remote data security?

Of course, not all businesses can go remote. However, there may be the chance that some—even if not all—of your business operations can be carried out from remote locations. Knowing the answers to the questions above will help you be prepared for this transition if necessary.

### 4. Ensure your internal IT team has a business continuity plan

In addition to planning for the distribution of essential hardware to remote workers, you’ll want to make sure that your IT team has its own business continuity plan in place. Important components to consider:

-   Processes to access physical hardware if it fails
-   Plans to establish backups and failsafes to keep data secure and systems online
-   Timelines for deploying essential updates and managing helpdesk requests during times of stress or crisis
-   Procedures for working with external service providers engaged as part of the RIM rollout
