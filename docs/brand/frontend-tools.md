## Build Tools

- [Webpack](#webpack)
- [Parcel](#parcel)
- [Rollup](#rollup)

### Webpack

Webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

### Parcel

Parcel is a web application bundler, differentiated by its developer experience. It offers blazing fast performance utilizing multicore processing, and requires zero configuration.

### Rollup

Rollup is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It uses the new standardized format for code modules included in the ES6 revision of JavaScript, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD.

## Package Managers

- [npm](#npm)
- [Yarn](#yarn)
- [pnpm](#pnpm)

### npm

npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

### Yarn

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that was created by Facebook. It is a fast, reliable, and secure dependency management tool that uses a lockfile to ensure that the same dependencies are installed on every machine.

### pnpm

pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient package manager that uses hard links and symlinks to save one version of a module only ever once on a disk. It is a drop-in replacement for npm.

## Linters

- [ESLint](#eslint)
- [Prettier](#prettier)
- [Stylelint](#stylelint)

### ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It is highly configurable and can be used to enforce a coding style and coding conventions.

### Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that supports many languages and can be integrated into most editors. It enforces a consistent code style across your entire codebase.

### Stylelint

Stylelint is a modern CSS linter that helps you enforce consistent conventions and avoid errors in your stylesheets.

## Generators

- [Create React App](#create-react-app)
- [Vue CLI](#vue-cli)
- [Angular CLI](#angular-cli)
- [Plop](#plop)

### Create React App

Create React App is a tool that sets up a new React project with a single command. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

### Plop

Plop is a micro-generator framework that allows you to create new files based on templates. It is useful for generating boilerplate code, such as components, reducers, and sagas.

## React Tools

- [React Router](#react-router)
- [React Query](#react-query)
- [React Hot Loader](#react-hot-loader)
- [PropTypes](#proptypes)
- [Redux DevTools](#redux-devtools)
- [Redux Toolkit](#redux-toolkit)

### React DevTools

React DevTools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect the React component hierarchy in the Chrome and Firefox Developer Tools.

### React Router

### Redux DevTools

Redux DevTools is a powerful tool for debugging and inspecting your Redux application. It provides a visual representation of your Redux store and allows you to track state changes over time.

### Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides a set of tools and best practices that simplify the development of Redux applications.

## Testing Tools

- [Jest](#jest)
- [Cypress](#cypress)
- [React Testing Library](#react-testing-library)

### Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that is built on top of Jasmine. It is designed to be easy to set up and use, and provides a rich set of features for testing your JavaScript code.

### Cypress

Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications. It allows you to write tests that interact with your application in the same way that a user would, and provides a rich set of features for testing your application.

### React Testing Library

React Testing Library is a testing library for React that encourages best practices for testing. It provides a simple and intuitive API for interacting with your React components and asserting that they behave as expected.
