## Colors

> [!NOTE]
> People are visual creatures. We can’t help it! We’re influenced by the things we see, and color combinations have a major impact on how we perceive and react to things.

Color communicates on both conscious and subconscious levels, and where language can’t. **The right color combinations can draw in attention, generate emotion, and ultimately leave a lasting impression.**

With so much on the line, choosing the right color combinations can be difficult if you have limited design experience and time. So, we’ve covered the basics of choosing colors in a beginner-friendly way! You’ll find color inspiration for interior design, branding, beauty, fashion, and everything in between.

### Color Wheel

>   Working with the color theory wheel is the best way to start when choosing your logo colors. The color wheel contains warm colors (red, yellow, orange) on the left side and cool colors (blue, green, and purple) on the right. Understanding the relationship between colors and how they interact on the color wheel is the key to successful design.

-   **Complementary color combinations** are colors that sit on opposite sides of the color wheel. These two colors create contrast and make for high-impact, legible brand designs.
-   **Analogous color combinations** are two to five colors that sit beside each other on the color wheel. These colors generally create a sense of harmony and balance. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature, where one color dominates and the others support its depth.
-   **Triadic color combinations** are rich and vibrant color combinations. Use the triadic color theory if you’re looking for a dynamic three-color palette. Simply draw a triangle on the color wheel and you’ll hit three colors that are evenly spaced out.

All colors are made by mixing the primary colors red, blue, and yellow together in different quantities. It can be hard to believe at first but check out the color wheel below to see it in action.

By mixing two primary colors, you create a secondary color. By mixing a secondary color with a primary color, you create a tertiary color.

-   **Primary colors:** Red, blue, yellow
-   **Secondary colors:** Orange purple, green
-   **Tertiary colors:** Blue-green, red-orange, yellow-green

### Choosing Primary and Secondary Colors

>   **Tip: In logo design, you’ll want to select one color to dominate and the other two as accents.**

### Examples

#### Black and Red

Daring and surprisingly inviting, this fierce logo color combination dominates and instills a sense of power and energy. The intense red draws the eye to the company name, while the black provides a grounding background color. Red signals passion, danger, and intrigue in color psychology. It can be used to generate excitement, especially when paired with a color as stark as black.

#### Black and Orange

This black and orange logo is a strong yet friendly pairing. The orange provides a dose of optimism, while the black is a professional and grounded counterpart. This logo color combination would work well for the film and music industries.

#### Charcoal Grey and Taupe

This is a very classy combination, great for hospitality logos as well as photography logos. Use the black as a background color and bring the taupe in as an accent to make a sophisticated statement.

#### Black and Silver

What color goes with silver, you ask? Nothing works better than black. Black is the perfect neutral tone to allow a silver foil really shine. A stark, professional, yet intriguing and mysterious color combination, black and silver make a very sophisticated pair.

#### Navy with Orange Gradient

This logo uses complementary colors blue and orange, as well as a gradient to make a high-impact statement. It remains professional while still being visually interesting with the use of an orange gradient to outline a mountain range.

### Sage and Pine Green

The neutral shade at the top of this color scheme has a green undertone, a great foundation for playing with the more moody greens below it. Greens can be vivid and refreshing, or deep and calming. We like this green color palette because, depending on how you use it, you can achieve either effect.

The green in the center intentionally resembles [Sherwin Williams’ color of the year](https://sherwin-williams.com/color-of-the-year-2022), Evergreen Fog, making this a popular color combination choice for 2024.
