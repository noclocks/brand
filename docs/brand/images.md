## Compression

Image compression **reduces the size of an image file without significantly degrading its visual quality**, which is important for fast data transmission and efficient caching. Whether you're viewing a website, sharing a photo over a messaging app, or storing thousands of pictures on a cloud server, image compression plays a critical role.

There are two main types of image compression:

1.  **Lossy compression**: As the name implies, some data is lost while using this approach. To reduce the file size, less crucial data from the original image is removed. When used excessively, it can cause visible artifacts and a notable drop in image quality, yet it typically results in a reduction in storage requirements.
2.  **Lossless compression**: This technique ensures that once an image is compressed, it can be perfectly decompressed back to its original state without any data loss. This makes it the perfect option to choose *during the encoding process* for images needing to retain visual integrity. Several file types, including PNG and some variations of WebP, use lossless compression.

## Pixel Density and Resolution

Pixel density refers to the **number of pixels present per unit of display area**, typically measured as Pixels Per Inch (PPI).

Resolution is the **total count of pixels in an image's width and height**. Devices with high pixel densities, e.g. Retina displays, may require images with higher resolutions to appear crisp. However, larger resolutions come at the cost of larger file sizes.
