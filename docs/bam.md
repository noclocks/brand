## DAM vs. BAM

Digital Asset Management (DAM) and Brand Asset Management (BAM) are two different systems that serve different purposes. DAM is a system that helps organizations store, organize, and manage digital assets such as images, videos, documents, and other files. BAM, on the other hand, is a system that focuses specifically on managing brand assets such as logos, brand guidelines, marketing materials, and other brand-related content.

## Use Cases

Wondering how brand asset management systems can be put to use? Here are some examples to give you a glimpse into how BAM can help your organization:

-   **Consolidation:** Organization is key when it comes to managing your assets. Finding specific brand assets can be time-consuming and difficult when assets are stored in multiple folders across different platforms. With brand asset management systems, you can quickly find what you’re looking for. BAM software helps you consolidate all your branded assets into folders to create an exhaustive library where all your content lives. This makes it easier for your team to find and use the correct assets.
-   **Consistency:** Maintaining brand identity through consistent use of brand assets is far easier when a brand asset management system is in place. You can ensure the most recent versions of files are accessible, restrict the use of outdated files, and give users a place to create, manage, share, and collaborate while following brand guidelines. You can ensure consistent usage across all channels, such as brand storytelling in content marketing and asset use on social media.
-   **Automation:** BAM systems allow you to automate manual tasks and create workflows to increase team productivity. This reduces bottlenecks that could hold up a project, and it allows your team to put more time into creative work.
-   **Acceleration:** Finding specific brand assets can be time-consuming and difficult when assets are stored in multiple folders across different platforms. With brand asset management systems, you can quickly find what you’re looking for. Plus, BAMs allow you to easily search through your assets by using AI and metadata to attach tags to assets.
-   **Analysis:** Instead of using guesswork to gauge how assets are being used, brand asset management systems allow you to look at asset ROI with precise, valuable insights so you can maximize the use of your digital assets to support your business goals.
-   **Templating:** When creatives are finished with a new asset, they can easily save the template so that approved users can repurpose the design — this saves time when creating branded assets.

## Best Practices

Brand asset use should be intentional, consistent, and targeted. Here are some BAM best practices you can leverage to improve your team’s brand asset management:

-   **Prioritize Centralized Management:** Whether you have dozens of files or thousands, brand asset management systems solve the problems of managing assets by acting as one central hub for all of your files. With BAM systems, you can easily access your in-house videos, social media collateral, and design files all in one place.
-   **Create Unique Taxonomy:** With brand asset management, you can create your own asset libraries with a system that organizes files with the end user in mind. Metadata and tagging features help improve searchability and ensure users can easily find the correct assets.
-   **Identify Brand Representatives:** At the end of the day, your employees are the ones who represent your brand. Conduct training sessions and make sure they’re always equipped with the resources they need to execute your BAM strategy and utilize your BAM software.
-   **Use a Single Source of Truth:** When brand asset management systems are used to distribute assets, these systems are able to serve as a single source of truth for your teams. This means you can centralize brand content, keep an organized library, and take advantage of AI-powered features.
-   **Use Brand Templates:** Brand templates empower everyone on your team — non-creatives and creatives alike — to create and deploy content while keeping it on-brand and compliant. Brand templating also helps get more campaigns launched faster without inundating your creative team.
