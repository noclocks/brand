## Overview

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Twitter (X)
- LinkedIn
- Pinterest
- TikTok
- Snapchat
- YouTube
- Reddit
- WhatsApp

## Social Media Strategy

A social media strategy is a plan that outlines how a brand will use social media to achieve its goals. It includes the brand's goals, target audience, content strategy, posting schedule, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Logo Guidelines

When using a logo on social media, it's important to follow the platform's guidelines to ensure that the logo is displayed correctly and maintains its integrity. Here are some general guidelines for using a logo on social media:

- Use the correct file format: `PNG` is almost always the best choice for logos on social media because of its versatility, ability to resize without losing quality, and support for transparency.

- Use the correct dimensions: Each social media platform has its own recommended dimensions for logos. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure that the logo is displayed correctly.

- Use the correct color scheme: Logos should be displayed in their original colors whenever possible. If the logo needs to be displayed in a different color scheme, make sure to use the correct version of the logo.

- Use the correct file size: Social media platforms have file size limits for images. Make sure that the logo file size is within the platform's limits to avoid any issues.

#### Considerations

- If you have a symbol-only version of your logo, it can be a great choice for profile photos on social media because it makes a bigger impact in a smaller space.

- For cover photos, you can use your entire logo (symbol + wordmark), or use another image with your logo placed on top. Experiment with profile and cover photo-combinations on each channel to see what works best for your brand.

- **Stay Consistent**: Use the same logo across all social media platforms to maintain brand consistency and recognition. For example, if you're putting a white-on-blue version of your logo on Facebook, use that version on your other social profiles. Keeping your logo and color scheme consistent is an easy way to be more recognizable to prospects and clients.

- **Test across Devices**: Make sure your logo looks good on all devices. Test it on desktop, tablet, and mobile to ensure it's legible and looks good at all sizes.

- **Use High-Quality Images**: Make sure your logo is high-quality and looks good at all sizes. A pixelated or blurry logo can make your brand look unprofessional.

- **Use the Right File Format**: Use the correct file format for your logo. For social media, `PNG` is usually the best choice because it supports transparency and can be resized without losing quality.

- **Create a Social Media Kit**: Create a social media kit that includes different versions of your logo for different social media platforms. This will make it easier to use your logo across all platforms and ensure that it looks good on each one.


#### Facebook

> See [Facebook Help: Pages Profile Picture and Cover Photo Dimensions](https://www.facebook.com/help/125379114252045?helpref=faq_content) for more information.

From Facebook's Help Center:

**Profile Picture**:

- Displays at `176x176` pixels on your Page on computers, `196x196` pixels on smartphones, and `36x36` pixels on most feature phones.

- Cropped to a circle

**Cover Photo**:

- Left aligns with a full bleed and a `16:9` aspect ratio

- Must be at least `400px` wide and `150px` tall.

- Loads fastest as an `sRGB JPG` file that's `851px` wide, `315px` tall and less than `100kb`.

For profile pictures and cover photos with your logo or text, you may get a better result by using a PNG file.

The left side of your cover photo will be partially covered by your profile picture, and may be cropped and resized to fit different screens.

#### Twitter

> See [Twitter Help: How to Customize Your Profile](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-customize-your-profile) for more information.

From Twitter's Help Center:

- **Header Photo** or "Banner": `1500x500` pixels

#### Instagram

> See [Instagram Help: Add Profile Picture or Change Current Picture On Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/557544397610546) for more information.

> **Note:**
> We recommend changing your profile photo on your phone, as you cannot upload PNG files when changing your Instagram profile photo on desktop. You can email the logo file to yourself and save it to your phone.

#### LinkedIn

> See [LinkedIn Help: Image Specifications for LinkedIn Pages](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a563309/) and [LinkedIn Help: Edit Company Photos on the What We Do Tab of LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a566371/) for more information.

From LinkedIn's Help Center:

When updating your LinkedIn Page images, we recommend the following specifications.

- All images must be `PNG` or `JPEG` files and have a maximum size of `3MB`.

| Tab  | Module         | Minimum image size        | Recommended image size    |
|------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Page | Logo image     | 268 (w) x 268 (h) pixels  | 400 (w) x 400 (h) pixels  |
| Page | Cover image    | 1128 (w) x 191 (h) pixels | 1128 (w) x 191 (h) pixels |
| Life | Main image     | 1128 (w) x 376 (h) pixels | 1128 (w) x 376 (h) pixels |
| Life | Custom modules | 502 (w) x 282 (h) pixels  | 502 (w) x 282 (h) pixels  |
| Life | Company photos | 264 (w) x 176 (h) pixels  | 900 (w) x 600 (h) pixels  |

LinkedIn Pages are available on multiple devices and screen sizes. Your cover image might be adjusted to fit the screen, which might trim the image horizontally or vertically. We recommend uploading a high-quality image with limited text to ensure an optimal display on all devices and screen sizes.

Your logo image will be displayed on both light and dark backgrounds. If your logo is transparent, it will be shown on a white background. We recommend testing your logo to ensure it displays correctly on both light and dark backgrounds.

You can also use Vimeo or YouTube URLs for the main image or video and custom module sections of your Life tab. The static image for the video is taken from the thumbnail image on Vimeo or YouTube. To change the static image, update the thumbnail for that video on Vimeo or YouTube.

When adding custom images to a Page post with a URL, consider the following image display guidelines:

- Use a `1.91:1` ratio (`1200 x 627` pixels).
- Image must be more than `200` pixels wide.
  - If your image width is less than `200` pixels, it will appear as a thumbnail on the left side of the post
  - This doesn't apply if you're posting an image only or an image and text. The image will be enlarged to fit the feed.
- Images on mobile won't be cropped. Images of other ratios will appear in full size with subtle white padding.
